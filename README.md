🎓 I’m Sathish Kumar Balagonda, an Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student with a growing passion for software development — especially in Java-based backend systems.

💡 Though rooted in hardware fundamentals, I’ve expanded into the world of coding by building hands-on projects like a console-based ATM Management System using Java, MySQL, and JDBC. This project deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming, database integration, and clean code practices.

🔧 My technical skills include:
- Programming: Java, JDBC, MySQL, Git
- Concepts: OOPs, console applications, DB connectivity
- Interests: Backend development, real-world problem solving, and exploring embedded software integration

🚀 I believe in learning by doing — and I’m constantly building, refining, and sharing projects to improve my skills. My GitHub reflects this journey, with clean code, structured README files, and a commitment to continuous growth.

📌 Currently open to internships, collaborations, or mentorship in software development.
