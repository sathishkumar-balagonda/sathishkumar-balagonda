ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m Sathish, an Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student with a growing passion for software development â€” especially in Java-based backend systems.

ðŸ’¡ Though rooted in hardware fundamentals, Iâ€™ve expanded into the world of coding by building hands-on projects like a console-based ATM Management System using Java, MySQL, and JDBC. This project deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming, database integration, and clean code practices.

ðŸ”§ My technical skills include:
- Programming: Java, JDBC, MySQL, Git
- Concepts: OOPs, console applications, DB connectivity
- Interests: Backend development, real-world problem solving, and exploring embedded software integration

ðŸš€ I believe in learning by doing â€” and Iâ€™m constantly building, refining, and sharing projects to improve my skills. My GitHub reflects this journey, with clean code, structured README files, and a commitment to continuous growth.

ðŸ“Œ Currently open to internships, collaborations, or mentorship in software development and embedded systems.
